# pathfinder
Pathfinder program made with C++11 and SFML 2.5
This was developed in a Linux environment and not tested in Windows, but all the resources used are platform agnostic.
Instructions on how to use it are at the bottom of the SFML Window.  
It's behavior can be changed by modifying the constant values at the beginning of the .cpp file. Currently they can't change during runtime because apparently global variables aren't good practice in C++.
